# Manuals
### Hello everyone, these are the official manuals for this repository
So before we begin please downlaod the whole repository as a zipfile and then exctract them
this will help you to understand all the stuff which i'm gonna explain here

So first things first 
open the file which you have downloaded

You will see these file:

File_Decrytptor

File_Encrytptor

key.txt

key_generate

Manuals.md

passwordsaver.py

Readme.md

Before you do anything in that file, do the following :

1. Open ''key_generate''

you will find it opening and then closing itself, don't worry about that

Now again open that file and now open "key.txt"
You will find a wierd text
Now repeat the proccess, you will find that the text in the file always changes
This a key for the rest of the encryptor and the decryptor files, so don't mess with them

Next open the ''File_Encrytptor''
You will find that it asks a password, the password is "692008"
this is just to ensure that the right person encrypts or decrypts the data
If you don't want the password you can ofcourse remove the password or change it

So now after you enter the password it will say "File to encrypt."
Now before doing anything, just save a blank text docutment to expirement and write some text in it.
(Make sure it's in the same directory or just copy the whole file path)
